For Required Lists data, put different keywords and try. Please download the video as well with the py file, I showed how it works.

NOTE: for requirements list, you needto use AI to scrap the needed info from the html tag. It does not work with regex, always. All the jobs have different headline for the required skills, so AI will recognise it. I did not have time and enough data, so could not add, but used regex.

NER(Name Entity Recognition) model, please search with that name. You can use my code, just replace the data with the data from linkedin. You take and all the text and extract the skills manually to collect the data. Once you have some, train it with my code. So the AI will recognise it NLP power, not keywords or regex but the strings, encodings.

see the code to get some understanding.

I have done all the steps. About collecting more data like this, we should put as many links as possible into the txt file and send it to the code. So it returns the csv dataset. It is 
easy if the code is deployed as a telegram bot. But it would be better to write this code with NLTK libary. That is the best for preprocesing the text data. We may use bag of words, 
tf-dtf or word2text to convert text to numbers. 

And about the project "tahrirchi", we can do it with NLP. We will be using LSTM and GRU APIs or transformers to classify and predict the texts. I have some experience with NLP, so if there is needed data, I may train a model that gives suggestions and even correct the mistakes. Or we may even create chat bot in Uzbek Language.
