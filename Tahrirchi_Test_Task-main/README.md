# Tahrirchi_Test_Task
I have done all the steps. About collecting more data like this, we should put as many links as possible into the txt file and send it to the code. So it returns the csv dataset. It is easy if the code is deployed as a telegram bot. But it would be better to write this code with NLTK libary. That is the best for preprocesing the text data. We may use bag of words, tf-dtf or word2text to convert text to numbers. 

And about the project "tahrirchi", we can do it with NLP. We will be using LSTM and GRU APIs or transformers to classify and predict the texts. I have some experience with NLP, so if there is needed data, I may train a model that gives suggestions and even correct the mistakes. Or we may even create chat bot in Uzbek Language.
